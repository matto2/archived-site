<p>At FastPencil I made a complete overhaul of the online publishing platform in order to improve the user experience and visual design. The added goal was to create a brandable platform that could be licensed to other book sellers who wanted to offer their own self-publishing service.</p>
<!--<p>The original FastPencil was not very brandable for a number of reasons: Too many colors and no clear hierarchy of elements. Additionally there were usability issues: the ability to select from existing projects is lost within the other competing elements and the ability to start a new project was not clear.</p>-->

<p>The new dashboard is easily branded and has a simple and clear choice of actions: the primary being starting a new project while displaying clear access to all of the user's existing projects.</p>
<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Books a Million and On Demand Books have have both licensed the platform. They've each done some  branding as expected but the product experience and much of the look-and-feel remains intact. Also Fast Pencil was acquired at this time based on the updated platform offering.

Additionally there were usability issues: the ability to select from existing projects is lost within the other competing elements and the ability to start a new project was not clear.</p>

<p>The new dashboard in contrast is easily branded and has a simple and clear choice of actions: the primary being starting a new project while displaying clear access to all of the user's existing projects. The design is less intrusive and invites users to more easily engage with their own creations.</p>
